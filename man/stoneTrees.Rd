\title{Solve Minimum Steiner Tree (MStT) and Maximum-Weight Connected Subgraph Problems Using Integer Linear Programming}
\description{
A package dedicated to finding minimum Steiner trees in networks. Particularly biological ones,
which tend to be very sparse and on the easier end of the spectrum. This package is especially
interested in Minimum Steiner Tree (MStT) and Maximum-Weight Connected Subgraph (MWCS) problems.
}
\details{
This package serves as a faithful implementation of "Thinning out Steiner Trees" (with a few bells and whistles added on the sides).
