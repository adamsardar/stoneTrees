#' Solve Minimum Steiner Tree (MStT) and Maximum-Weight Connected Subgraph Problems Using Integer Linear Programming
#'
#' A package dedicated to finding minimum Steiner trees in networks. Particularly biological ones,
#' which tend to be very sparse and on the easier end of the spectrum. This package is especially
#' interested in Minimum Steiner Tree (MStT) and Maximum-Weight Connected Subgraph (MWCS) problems.
#'
#' This package serves as a faithful implementation of "Thinning out Steiner Trees" (with a few bells and whistles added on the sides).
