Description: A package aimed at solving Steiner ('stone') tree problems with uniform edge weights,
    such as the Minimum Steiner Tree (MStT) and Maximum-Weight Connected Subgraph (MWCS) problems. It
    serves as an R implementation of the paper Fischetti M et al., Thinning out Steiner trees: a node-based model for uniform edge costs. Math Program Comp (2017).
